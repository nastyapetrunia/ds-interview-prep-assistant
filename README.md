# ðŸ§  ds-interview-prep-assistant

A personal assistant to help me prepare for data science interviews by turning my Notion notes into an intelligent, searchable knowledge base. The long-term goal is to power a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that helps me test myself, recall concepts, and stay sharp.

Right now, the focus is on **collecting and parsing data from Notion**.
